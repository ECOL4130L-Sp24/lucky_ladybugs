This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(here)
```
Grabbing data from R 
```{r}

#water quality 
water_quality <- "DP1.20288.001"

# Two selected focal sites
my_sites <- c("CRAM", "TOOK", "PRLA")

# Start date (as YYYY-MM)
start_date <- "2016-03"

# End date (as YYYY-MM)
end_date <- "2021-12"
```


```{r}
# Step 1: Read the CSV files into separate data frames
df1 <- read.csv("alg_biomass_means.csv") 
df2 <- read.csv("final_fish_count_means.csv")
df3 <- read.csv("waterqual_means.csv")
df4 <- read.csv("SW_Nitrate_means.csv")
  

# Step 2: Combine the data frames into one
merged_data_all <- rbind(df1, df2, df3, df4)

# Step 3: Write the merged data frame into a new CSV file
write.csv(merged_data_all, "merged_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Check the first few rows of the merged data frame
head(merged_df)
```
