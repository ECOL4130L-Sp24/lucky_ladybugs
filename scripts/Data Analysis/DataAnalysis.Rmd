## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Step 1: Read the CSV files into separate data frames
df1 <- read.csv("alg_biomass_means.csv") 
df2 <- read.csv("final_fish_count_means.csv")
df3 <- read.csv("waterqual_means.csv")
df4 <- read.csv("SW_Nitrate_means.csv")
  

# Step 2: Combine the data frames into one
merged_data_all <- rbind(df1, df2, df3, df4)

# Step 3: Write the merged data frame into a new CSV file
write.csv(merged_data_all, "merged_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Check the first few rows of the merged data frame
head(merged_df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
