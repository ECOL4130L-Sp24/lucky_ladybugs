A linear regression was performed to predict the relationship between nitrate concentration and algal biomass. The results of the linear regression indicated that nitrate concentration explained -11.94% of the variation in algal biomass (F(1,6)=0.2535, p=0.6326, R^2=-0.05871).

linear_model2 <- lm(mean_weight ~ mean_adjAshFreeDryMass, data = merged_data_all)

```

A linear regression was performed to predict the relationship between fish abundance and algal biomass. The results of the linear regression indicated that algal biomass explained 24.96% of the variation in fish abundance (F(1,9)=4.327, p=0.06725, R^2=0.2202).

Figure 1. The affect of Mean Fish Biomass on Mean Algal Biomass across 3 sites(CRAM, TOOK, PRLA) from 2016-2019. The trend line indicates that as Fish Biomass increases, Algal Biomass decreases with the grey section representing a 95% confidence interval to the line of best fit.

Figure 2. The effect of Mean Surface Water Nitrate on Mean Algal Biomass across 3 sites (CRAM, TOOK, PRLA) from 2016-2019. The trend line indicates that as Surface Water Nitrogen levels increase, Algal Biomass increases as well with many variations in the data as Nitrate concentrations increase (95% confidence interval). the higher  (F(1,6)=0.254, p=0.633, R^2= -0.119)
