# The Effects of Fish Abundance on Algal Blooms

Reina, Braylee, Niko

## Project overview

While many studies have assessed the relationship between fish and phytoplankton, many take place at a singular site and suggest the relationship is one directional as opposed to interrelated. This paper will assess the processes in lakes from the fundamental ecological assumption that all processes are interdependent. Moreover, this paper will assess fish and phytoplankton relationships at various sites across the United States using the National Ecological Observatory Network. This investigation will assess the interconnected relationship between phytoplankton, fish, and water nutrients; both in how fish population govern the abundance of phytoplankton but also how â€œbottom-up" effects of nutrient content impact algal biomass. Our group anticipates that there will be more of a bottom-up effect on the algae from nutrients in comparison to the effect of fish abundance. Furthermore, the nutrients we will be testing will be phosphorous, nitrogen and dissolved oxygen. We plan on testing this through utilizing 'R', where we will be able to organize the data into tables and graphs that will show us relationships between our data sets and allow us to draw conclusions about each individual site. The data we will be looking for is what happens to algal bloom and fish abundance when one or the other changes. Additionally, do any properties such as oxygen content change with movement of either population?

## Data used

The data sets we will be using include water quality, phytoplankton, and fish netting data given by NEON to find connections and/or trends amongst three different sites. The water quality data contains information on the oxygen content of the water that we plan on measuring to further investigate the impact that these species relationships has on their ecosystems. Additionally, the fish netting and phytoplankton data contain species abundance over long periods of time. These data sets will give us enoough information for us to draw conclusions and answer our hypothesis confidently. We will be drawing data from Lake Toolik, Lake Crampton, and Prairie Lake respectively. These are three sites that are utilized under the National Ecological Obervatory Network (NEON). NEON colllects all different types of data yearround for people like us to draw from and utilize. The dates we chose to test were from March of 2016, until December of 2021. It will be easier to find more correlations between the data over a longer period of time simply due to the increased amount of data available.
